### pad_sequences
After we use our [[tf.keras.preprocessing.text]] methods we want to pad the sequences into a matrix
###### padding =
pre or post
#### Sentence Length
###### maxlen =
will truncate the sentences from default pre

###### truncating
will modify the maxlen to which we can apply the 'post' property
