This is the core mechanic for both neural networks and CNNs. Interestingly enough we don't flatten for CNNs when we do for NNs.


### Convolutional Layers
Accomplished through [[tf.keras.layers.Conv2D]]

A poorly designed convolutional layer can actually make your training slower, it could even be less efficient than just using DNN.
