* start with forest of single vertex "trees" spanning the graph
	* min w crossing cut btw {v} and V - {v}
* the min w e incident on eny v is in the MST
  the min w e with one v in foreste T_i is in the MST
	* min w crosssing the cut btw T_i and V - T_i
* Basically we are checking to see if the edge appears in either component to see if it is worthy of adding
