MSE squares errors because a error in the other direction (negative) still should be considered as a error away from what we want.

RMSE: mean of error's calc to be of same scale as og errors then we take sqrt

MAE: uses absolute value instead of squaring negatives, also penalizes big errors less than MSE

MAPE: mean ratio between the absolute error and absolute value: compares size of errors to values
