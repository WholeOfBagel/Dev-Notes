### Human Centered Design Approach
* We actually prefer that the data be labeled with a number instead of words so as not to bias for a specific language.

### Identify multiple metrics to assess training and monitoring
* contextually gathering different metrics and tuning our system for higher/lower sensitivity towards false positive/negatives

### when possible, directly examine your raw data
* There can always be sneaky discrepancies within the data
* Simplest model for the best return on performance for your goals

### Limitations of dataset/model
* Make sure we are not drawing cause when there is only correlation - and make sure your model is not separating people on qualities that you ethically would not have either
* The clean environment of the data may not represent the intended environment for function

### Testing
* self-evident

### Continue to monitor and update the system after deployment
